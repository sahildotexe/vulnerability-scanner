# Vulnerability-Scanner
A vulneribility scanner which checks for four types of vulnerabilities such as sql injection, cross-site scripting, remote code execution and file inclusion vulnerability
in other websites.

# Problem Statement
A vulnerbitlity scanner is needed because a lot of sites are prone to malicious attacks these days which results in the leak of the user's data. This is usually due to the way the website has been coded/sanitised or due to some external agents which insert malicious files into the webpage. These files are then executed as a part of the webpage. 

# Solution
We have made a vulnerability scanner to detect the attacks such websites are prone to. This scanner helps prevent the breach of user's data by correctly identifying the vulnerabilities. 

We have made a website where you can input the URL of any website and check if one or more of these vulnerabilities are present or not. It will also give the percentage of how insecure the website based on the number of vulnerabilities present. For this we are using a crawler with attacks automated in python.
